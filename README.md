### Apple's Apple Pay
--- 
**Apple's Background:**
Apple is one of the world's leading innovators in computer technology. They are a direct competitor to Microsoft in the computing industry. Apple is such a diversified company though, that you almost have to think of Apple Pay as a sub-branch of Apple. When you speak more specifically of Apple Pay they act as a direct competitor to Google's Google Pay.

**Apple's Technological Advantage:**

When considering traditional credit cards, there's a security risk inherit to your card being a physical piece of plastic. That card can be stolen and used, or even more frequently in the digital age, the information that card represents can be stolen when you use it on websites or apps, or even when swiping in the real world. In traditional transactions, such as swiping your card in a brick and mortar retail location, your credit card communicates with the teller to reveal your Primary Account Number(PAN), which can then be stored by the merchant. With Apple Pay, your PAN is never shared with the retailer. For more information check out this article!

**An Exemplary Company**

The company is exemplary in the FinTech because of their expertise in tech and the wide ecosystem they have built. Apple Pay was added to this ecosystem a few years ago, and allows users across Apple products to pay with their Apple devices using digital versions of their credit or debit cards. Moreover, the recent addition of Apple cash makes it easy for them to transfer money between users, to reimburse a coworker for example.
